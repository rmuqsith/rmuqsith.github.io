    &emsp;Hello! my name is Muhammad Rafid Muqsith I'm an Minangnese, born in
    Pekanbaru and raised in Tangerang. Since childhood I moved several times,
    there are quite a number of places that I've moved to. Even so I have a
    hard time memorizing also remembering the when, the what, and especially the where (le kind of person who gets lost without a map :D). However, it got me used to adapting and it made me
    love to try out things.<br />
    &emsp;My current interest is Game Development particularly in Level
    Design. I'm also having a go at the Unreal Engine with its Blueprint and
    C++ for personal projects. I enjoy art too. Previously I had some
    experience in shooting and editing photos as well as videos. For the
    moment I'm learning about 3d modeling and animating.
