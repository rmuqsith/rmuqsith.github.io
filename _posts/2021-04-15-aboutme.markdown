    &emsp;Hello! my name is Muhammad Rafid Muqsith. I'm a Computer Science graduate majoring in Game Application and Technology at Binus University, Jakarta. I love creating, fixing, or even—most of the time—breaking things. To experience and understand, and solve a problem if any, is what I am passionate about the most. My current interest is in Game Development, particularly in Level and Environmental Design. You can look at some of my works <a href = "/portfolio">here</a>. I’m still learning about it and up to now have a liking for it.<br /><br />More about me:<br/>
    &emsp;I’m a Minangnese, born in Pekanbaru and raised in Tangerang. Since childhood I moved several times, there are quite a number of places that I’ve moved to. And because of it, I got used to adapting and it also made me dare and excited to try out things.
