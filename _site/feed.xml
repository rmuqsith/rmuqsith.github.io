     Hello! my name is Muhammad Rafid Muqsith. I’m a Computer Science graduate majoring in Game Application and Technology at Binus University, Jakarta. I love creating, fixing, or even—most of the time—breaking things. To experience and understand, and solve a problem if any, is what I am passionate about the most. My current interest is in Game Development, particularly in Level and Environmental Design. I’m still learning about it and up to now have a liking for it. You can look at some of my works &lt;a href=&quot;/portfolio&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More about me:&lt;br /&gt;
     I’m a Minangnese, born in Pekanbaru and raised in Tangerang. Since childhood I moved several times, there are quite a number of places that I’ve moved to. And because of it, I got used to adapting and it also made me dare and excited to try out things.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rafid Muqsith</name><email>rafidmuqsith@gmail.com</email></author><category term="About" /><summary type="html"> Hello! my name is Muhammad Rafid Muqsith.
